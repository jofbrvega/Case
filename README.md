# Static Form

This project provides a static web form created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

## Description

This is a project created for a job application, where I was asked to create a webpage in plain HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The header should always stay at the top of the browser and the footer should be on the bottom of the page (but not in the same way the header).
The project should firstly be solved in HTML and CSS, Javascript is used where it is possible and reasonable. 

The code should be ideally easy to understand and accesible (WCAG level 3) and easy to maintain. When the form is filled, it should forward the visitor to page 2.
The information des not have to be stored somewhere, since the case is only aimed to see the front-end knowledge. 

There are a few guidelines I have to follow and that is: 

* Förnamn (not empty)
* E-post (valid Email adress, not empty)
* Postnummer (Only 5 digits och 3 + 2 digits, not empty)
* Förnamn på förälder (not empty, the value is not allowed to be equal to the field "Förnamn" it can only containt A-Z (capital/lower case) )

The project has two pages, a startpage and an endpage. 

The startpage contains a static web form with and an interactive information popup.
The second page (endpage) contains a thank you message and a "Back To Startpage" button.

The form is majorly created with HTML and CSS with som Javascript functions. To fulfill the sugges
